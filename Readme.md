# SaaS Company Landing Page

This is a simple project challenge that I took part In from a youtube channel from Traversy Media based on professional website for begginers.

This challenge website does not use any framework or libraries. it is built with pure HTML and CSS and a bit of Javascript for the hamburger menu and the FAQ accordion.
